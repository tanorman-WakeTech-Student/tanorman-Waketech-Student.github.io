# About Me
## My Interest
* I love to play Lego Fortnight. Sometimes I play Battle Royale Fortnight online with my grandson the lives in SC. I also have a passion for trying foods resturants that are new to me and trying my hand at cooking dishes that I have never cooked before. I guess I could be called a foodie.
## Websites I Recommend
* [The Official Website of Jehovah's Witnesses](www.jw.org)
 * As a Jehovah's Witness, I encounter many people that have misconceptions about abot our beliefs because of incorrect information sources. In any aspect of life, if people have questions, it is always better to get questions answered from the source.
* [Instagrm](www.intsagram.com)
 * I not only find entertaining video here, but I also have discovered many tasty recipes.
